# Bell

Browser, Edge or LocaL-first application foundation toolkit.

The goal is to experiment with a limited set of technologies that help to build apps quickly with the following parameters:

* the core business logic can potentially work as PWA, at the edge or at the backend rendered as HTML
* the dependencies are minimal
* the stack is simple enough, attempting to avoid Single Page Applications in the first round

Initial set of technologies selected:

* [Hono](https://hono.dev/) - as a versatile, lightweight framework that runs where needed
* [DataStar](https://data-star.dev/) - as the alternative for SPA frontend frameworks keeping the business logic mainly on "the server"
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as the language foundations

# Status

This project is highly experimental. Do not expect cleaned code, nicely packaged library or something you bootstrap with one line yet. But there is a plan for that.

However feel free to clone it and tune for your needs.

Contributions or comments are also welcomed.
